### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a mathematics and computational biology undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), previously enrolled in the Special Program in Science in NUS. 

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently researching generative modelling under Prof. Harold Soh at the Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) lab and Prof Jonathan Scarlett as an undergraduate researcher.

ðŸ’¼ I work as a part-time trainer for Tertiary Courses teaching Tensorflow, Pytorch, Sklearn and Python. I also previously helped out in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) with some data science projects during my 2-years conscripted. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning research or open source projects.
