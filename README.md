### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a mathematics and data science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), previously enrolled in the Special Program in Science in NUS. 

ðŸ§  I previously worked on generative modelling under Prof. Harold Soh at the Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) lab. I also worked with Prof Jonathan Scarlett as an undergraduate researcher on trying to use generative models as priors for inverse problems. **Currently, finding something new** to do please let me know if you have any open positions. 

ðŸ’¼ I work as a part-time trainer for Tertiary Courses teaching Tensorflow, Pytorch, Sklearn and Python. I also previously helped out in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) with some data science projects during my 2-years conscripted. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning research or open source projects. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You either reach me out on twitter, linkedin or email.
