### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Neoanarika/neoanarika** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

💻 I’m a mathematics and computational biology undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), previously enrolled in the Special Program in Science in NUS. 

🧠 I’m currently researching generative modelling under Prof. Harold Soh at the Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) lab and Prof Jonathan Scarlett as an undergraduate researcher.

📈 In my free time, I help out with the workshops team at NUS Statistics Society, delivering data science workshops in NUS. I also try to deepen my understanding of machine learning and reach a better approximation.

💼 I work as a part-time trainer for Tertiary Courses teaching Tensorflow, Pytorch, Sklearn and Python. I also previously helped out in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) with some data science projects during my 2-years conscripted. 

🔭 I’m currently working on generative modelling and trying to develop a deeper understanding of machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bandits and online learning algorithms. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning research or open source projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You either reach me out on twitter, linkedin or email.
